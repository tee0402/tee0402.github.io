Meteors are supposed to be cool and interesting to watch. But they can quickly become disasters if they are too large. The Meteor application architecture is similar. It was supposed to be a modern web development platform that uses JavaScript on both the client and the server to deliver a dynamic experience to users. However, it was overly ambitious. By trying to be able to do everything, it became cluttered with all sorts of frameworks and technologies. Development slows to a halt once an application becomes more complex than a "Hello World" program.

Despite its flaws, Meteor did come up with some good ideas for handling data. The client-side database is ingenious and works without a hiccup. To a user, data is synced to and from the server magically. To a developer, having the same code work on both the client and the server is a dream come true.

If Meteor is supposed to be one of the best web development platforms currently available, then I would take my PHP and run as far away from it as possible. If Meteor is to be viable for business use, a lot more work has to be done in order to optimize it for development. The Meteor development team should realize that, as with many things in life, less is more.
