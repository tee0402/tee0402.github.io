I am not a greedy person, but ever since my friend introduced me to the world of finance, I have been intrigued by how money can be used to make more money. It is remarkable to see how money can grow ten-fold, or even a hundred-fold, if allocated to the right investments, without much, if any, effort on the investor's part. Granted, investors must be somewhat knowledgable about the investments that they are making to minimize risks. But even that may not be a barrier to entry anymore, with software engineering at the forefront of simplifying and introducing finance to everyday people.

Because of the massive scale at which software applications can be deployed, costs associated with traditional brokerages such as commission fees can be eliminated altogether, as Robinhood has done for its users. This could be a step towards democratizing the markets and narrowing wealth inequality. Software engineering is also well-equipped to solve the complex problems in the world of finance. Quantitative analysts, or quants, make their living doing just that, by applying mathematics and computer science to create complex algorithms and risk management strategies for their firms.

Just as I am now starting to take a Software Engineering class, the world is just now realizing the extent of how software engineering can disrupt the financial industry. I hope to learn enough in this course to become a part of the software revolution. A lot of people say that money is not important and that you should pursue your passions, but I disagree. I believe that both are equally important. In my experience, the people who say that money is not important are usually not struggling to pay their bills.
