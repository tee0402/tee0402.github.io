JavaScript is everywhere. I first learned it when I was learning HTML and CSS to create a website. But I have also seen or used it in areas outside of web development, including some unexpected ones. It is used in Unity alongside C# to program scripts for games. It is used for scripting in Adobe Livecycle to create PDFs. Its object notation, JSON, is the standard data format for countless APIs which deal with data interchange.

Despite its ubiquity, there are some obvious flaws with JavaScript. The hoisting behavior of variables can be offputting to many developers new to JS. It is almost necessary to use the "use strict" directive so that JS will behave like a "proper" programming language. I learned some new things in ES6 and I think that it somewhat improved upon JS by giving developers additional tools to make code cleaner and more predictable.

Since JavaScript does not seem to be going away any time soon, it is important that those of us who use it learn to love it, or least not hate it. We should also find ways to make it better, perhaps through contributing to its open source frameworks. JavaScript has come a long way since its inception and continues to improve with every version. If we stick with it, maybe we will find that it is not as bad as everyone says it is.
