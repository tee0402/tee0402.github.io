I am not a greedy person, but ever since my friend introduced me to the world of finance, I have been intrigued by it and the possibilities that it can bring. It is remarkable how money can grow ten-fold, or even a hundred-fold, if allocated to the right investments, without much, if any, effort on the investor's part. Granted, investors must be somewhat knowledgable about the investments that they are making to minimize risks. But even that may not be a barrier to entry anymore, with software engineering at the forefront of simplifying and introducing finance to everyday people.

Software engineering is well-equipped to solve the complex problems in the world of finance. Quantitative analysts, or quants, make their living doing just that, by applying mathematics and computer science to create complex algorithms and risk management strategies for financial firms.

I am now starting to take a Software Engineering class. I hope to learn a lot through the course, but I know it will be just the beginning of my journey. By the time I’m done with it, I hope I’ve learned enough to take the next step in my life as a developer. But until then, my fire will keep on burning.
