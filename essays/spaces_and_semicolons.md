I have an obsession with spaces and semicolons in code. I agonize over whether I should leave a space after an "if" keyword. I am adamant about not putting opening curly braces on a new line and "lining them up" because I think that it just does not look good and is not worth the space of a new line.

Because of my background in other languages, I often mistakenly put a semicolon after a line when coding in Python, only to realize that it delimits lines by spacing instead of semicolons. At first I was angry with Python for not adhering to established coding standards that have been used for decades. But then I realized that maybe the standard was wrong. Maybe it <strong>is</strong> better to delimit statements based on spaces and newlines, which we already do (or should do) in other languages, and make the semicolon obsolete.
