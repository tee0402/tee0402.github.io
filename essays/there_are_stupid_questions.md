There is a saying that there are no stupid questions, but we all know that there are. It is very difficult to understand or answer a question asked by someone who does not know how to ask a good question. Since good software engineering involves good communication of the problems that you encounter, having the ability to ask good questions is paramount as a software engineer. It will lead to more time discussing solutions and less time figuring out what is being asked.

One of the questions that is asked the smart way is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5515310/is-there-a-standard-function-to-check-for-null-undefined-or-blank-variables-in">Is there a standard function to check for null, undefined, or blank variables in JavaScript?</a>. The question is clear and concise. To demonstrate effort, the questioner includes code that he has tried. But since he is not sure that it is the right solution, he asks other experts in the language. As a result, the answers are to the point and help to clear up misconceptions that the questioner had. Answerers even threw in additional tips to help the questioner, which would not have occurred if it was a stupid question.

A question that is not asked the smart way is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31024276/please-help-me-with-java-programming-errors">Please help me with programming errors</a>. Not only are there grammatical errors, the subject line is very vague and the questioner put the entire block of code into the question without describing the problem or highlighting the part that went wrong. The questioner also did not seem to have put any effort into trying to solve the problem. This made the answerers quite annoyed and confused, as they had to first figure out what the questioner is asking, although it is just a simple FizzBuzz program with the user inputting the maximum value. As a result, the answerers returned the favor by simply posting the fixed code and not explaining what is fixed or what it is doing, in turn making the questioners confused as well.

Given the importance and value of time in software engineering, it should not be wasted on asking or answering stupid questions. You should always spend time on a problem before asking others to spend time on helping you. By extending this courtesy to others, you can set a good example and probably improve your standing in the professional community.
