Meteors are supposed to be cool and interesting to watch. But they can quickly become disasters if they are too large. The Meteor application architecture is similar. It was supposed to be a modern web development platform that uses JavaScript on both the client and server to deliver a dynamic experience to users. However, it was overly ambitious. By trying to be able to do everything, it became cluttered with all sorts of frameworks and technologies. Development slows to a halt once an application becomes more complex than a "Hello World" program. Loading all the libraries and "features" can easily take longer than actually coding the application. When using Meteor to develop, you really have to ask yourself, is it worth sacrificing my development experience for someone else's user experience?

Despite its flaws, Meteor did come up with some good ideas for handling data. The client-side database is ingenious and works almost magically, without so much as a hiccup. To a user, having data synced to and from the server in real-time makes web applications effortless to use. To a developer, having the same code work on both the client and the server is a dream come true. I think that this notion of database structure should be replicated on other application architectures and frameworks because it has so many advantages over the alternatives.

If Meteor is supposed to be one of the best web development platforms currently available, then I will take my PHP and run as far away as possible. If Meteor is to be viable for business use, a lot more work has to be done in order to optimize it for development. The Meteor development team should realize that, as with many things in life, less is more.
