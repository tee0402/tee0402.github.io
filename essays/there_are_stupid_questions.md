There is a saying that there are no stupid questions, but we all know that there are. It is very difficult to understand or answer a question asked by someone who does not know how to ask a good question. Since good software engineering involves good communication of the problems that you encounter, having the ability to ask good questions is paramount as a software engineer. It will lead to more time discussing solutions and less time figuring out what you are asking.

One of the questions that is asked the smart way is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5515310/is-there-a-standard-function-to-check-for-null-undefined-or-blank-variables-in">Is there a standard function to check for null, undefined, or blank variables in JavaScript?</a>.

A question that is not asked the smart way is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31024276/please-help-me-with-java-programming-errors">Please help me with programming errors</a>.
