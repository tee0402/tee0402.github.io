Ethical software engineering requires a lot of effort on the part of software engineers. It requires them to constantly think about what they are doing and about the broader implications of their actions. Some may assert that ethical actions are simply ones that benefit, or at the very least, do not harm others. However, as with ethics in other fields, ethics in software engineering is subjective. What one software engineer considers to be ethical may not sit well with another.
