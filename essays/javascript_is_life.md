JavaScript is everywhere. I first learned it when I was learning HTML and CSS to create a website. But I have also seen or used it in areas outside of web development, including some unexpected ones. It is used in Unity alongside C# to program scripts for games. It is used for scripting in Adobe Livecycle to create PDFs. Its object notation, JSON, is the standard data format for countless APIs which deal with data interchange.

Despite its ubiquity, there are some obvious flaws with JavaScript. The hoisting behavior of variables can be offputting to many developers new to JS. It is almost necessary to use the "use strict" directive so that JS will behave like a "proper" programming language.
