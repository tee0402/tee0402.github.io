Ethical software engineering requires a lot of effort on the part of software engineers. It requires them to constantly think about what they are doing and about the broader implications of their actions. Some may assert that ethical actions are simply ones that benefit, or at the very least, do not harm others. However, harm is subjective. What one software engineer considers to be harmless may not sit well with another. In that sense, there is no fixed set of ethical rules in software engineering. Rather, it is the perceived principles and norms that the collective body of software engineers in the world expect other software engineers to follow. It is fluid because people enter and exit the field all the time and their view of what constitutes an ethical action is influenced by societal ethical norms, which are also fluid.

In the case of the Serial Swatter, it should be clear that what Obnoxious did was unethical and harmful. Sending a SWAT team to someone's home is dangerous and traumatic. It should also be clear that Twitch did not do enough to prevent harm to the female streamers. It should have recognized from the start that people can and will do anything online, when their anonymity is almost guaranteed. Online harassment is obviously a major issue, and since online lives are often intricately linked with real ones, online harassment can translate into physical harassment. This is difficult to prevent when people are putting more and more of their information on the web. This simply means that data security and privacy are more important than ever, and that the ethics of software engineers who are entrusted with the task of safeguarding that information become absolutely critical.

In a sense, the blame rests on more parties than Twitch. A chain of events allowed the swatting incidents to occur and it is possible that a single event could have put a stop to the whole chain. Twitch itself could certainly have algorithms in place to detect and ban offenders, as well as a specialized team to help victims of attacks like these. Companies like Amazon, which are entrusted with the personal information of their customers, could certainly have much stricter security policies in place to prevent social engineering attacks. The police could invest in technologies to distinguish between genuine and fake calls. It could also demilitarize its forces. The female streamers themselves could help with the situation by realizing that there should not be an expectation of privacy on the internet. They should use VPNs and refrain from posting personally identifiable information. This would make them much harder to track down.
