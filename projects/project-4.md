Venture is a dynamic website built with the Meteor framework. Its purpose is to allow UH students to find events and activities to do on the islands and even meet friends while doing so. This will serve as a distraction to their stressful schoolwork and make their college lives more fun and memorable.

This project was accomplished with a team of three in my software engineering class. It uses Meteor, a pure JavaScript framework for both the frontend and backend. This allowed us to create a dynamic, mobile-like experience on the web.

This project introduced me to Android app development concepts such as layouts, views and activities. I also learned some aspects of sound processing using Audacity.

Unfortunately the Google Play Store suspended the app for copyright infringement, so it is not on there. But the source code is on Github and I still have the apk, so it is still available for people who want it.
